# AndroidExamples
Complete Android projects that showcase common Android components and coding practices. These projects are highly-commented and as simple as possible, having just enough code to explain a concept and allow it to run locally. The examples can be used as a learning tool for those new to Android or as a reference for experienced developers.

## Organization
Each top-level directory contains a complete Android project that can be imported into AndroidStudio, run on emulator or real device, or be compiled into an APK.
 
## Learning from the Projects
Each project has its own README file which explains the relevant parts of its specific feature or component. But reading the comments in the project itself is probably the best way to learn.
