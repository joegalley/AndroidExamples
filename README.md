# AndroidExamples
This repo contains several complete Android apps that showcase common Android components and coding practices. Each app is as simple as possible, having just enough code to explain a single concept. The examples have lots of explanatory comments, and can be used as a learning tool for those new to Android or as a reference for experienced developers. The repo was originally created as an aid for a course I taught to new Android developers.

## Organization
Each top-level directory contains a complete Android project that can be imported into AndroidStudio, run on an emulator or real device, and compiled into an APK.
 
## Learning from the Projects
Each project has its own README file which explains the relevant parts of its specific feature or component. There are also comments directly in the code for deeper explainations. Most READMEs have links directly into the code to highlight important parts.
