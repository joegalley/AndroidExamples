    <!-- Since we are manually add a Toolbar view to activity_main.xml, we MUST append
    "NoActionBar" to our style, or else our Toolbar will appear below the top bar in our app.
    It will look like there are 2 toolbars. We don't want this, so "NoActionBar" is the fix.
    What this is doing, is replacing the build-in action bar that would have shown up if we didn't
    include "NoActionBar" and using our Toolbar view instead. Toolbar can be thought of as a replacement
    for the ActionBar. The main difference between the two is that Toolbar must be manually defined
    somewhere in your layout file, whereas the ActionBar does not (it's based on your theme and
    the type of Activity you're using). But use Toolbar instead of ActionBar because its features
    are a superset of ActionBar, and allow you to control more.
